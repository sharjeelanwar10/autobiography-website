            <h2>Individual Webpage Structure</h2>
            <h3>Home</h3>
            <p>The homepage has a div having class "top-head" for Title of the website. Then it has a header that includes a navigation bar which is consistent throughout the website. 
                Then it also has a div naming "intro-content", which includes all the main content. In the end, there's a footer with id "footer-p" for the aesthetics of footer. The footer is also consistent throughout the website.
            </p>
            <div id="image">
                <img src="img.png" alt="website view">
            </div>
            <h3>Past</h3>
            <p>
                The title of the website, the navigation and the footer is same as of homepage. In the main of this page, there are some divs with classes like "menu-list", "all-h1" for the aesthetics of this page. This page have unordered lists in it.
            </p>
            <h3>Future</h3>
            <p>
                In this page, there is only one div in the main with "intro-content" class which includes some paragraphs and headings.
            </p>
            <h2>Aesthetics Of The Website</h2>
            <p>Visitors are drawn attracted by aesthetics first. A website that is aesthetically appealing makes a good first
                impression and entices visitors to explore further.
                Utilizing the Nunito font family provides a modern and clean look to the website, enhancing readability.
                The font color of #666 creates a balanced contrast with the background.
                The font size of 1.1rem for paragraphs strikes a harmonious balance between readability and aesthetics.
                A font size of 2.5rem for h1 headings establishes a clear hierarchy and draws attention to important content.
                Using a font size of 1.8rem for h2 headings differentiates sections and provides visual structure.
                Incorporating a complementary color palette throughout the website ensures a cohesive and visually appealing design.
                Properly spaced elements, margins, and padding enhance the overall aesthetics by promoting content organization and
                readability.</p>
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Web accessibility standards and guidelines that support equality are promoted by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), which is well aware of this critical requirement. In addition to being required by law or morality, accessibility is crucial to the user experience.</p>
            <h3>Font Spacing</h3>
            <p>I have carefully modified the line heights and word spacing to improve reading, especially for people who are blind or visually impaired.</p>    
            <h3>Font Selection</h3>
            <p>My choice of fonts emphasises readability and reading comfort for all users. Instead of using decorative fonts that would have made it harder for readers to understand, I provided them with alternatives.</p>
            <h3>Font-Size</h3>
            <p>My design ensures that text remains clear and legible to everyone.</p>
            <h3>Colour Contrast</h3>
            <p>I have adhered to WCAG standards for color contrast ratios, with a particular emphasis on ensuring that the text has a sufficient contrast against the background.</p>
